# Ipv4 subnetting calculator
This is a tool for network/sys admins that don't want to go to websites or calculate the network range by himself.
Is written in **c**, so is fast.

## Why terminal based?
I am a terminal lover, and I like to create terminal to make my work easier, this is also a practise for me to learn more c language, so is possible that is not wrote in the most correct way, because I'm still learning c.

**but works:**

**If you find any bug or any part of the code can be wrote in a more correct way pls let me know :)**
